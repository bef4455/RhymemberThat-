## Why did I choose this game ? 
- I chose this game because I found it interesting to link sounds with memory, and to do so, I used the game (Simon Says) as a base.

[Demo](https://bef4455.github.io/RhymemberThat-/)
- The machine presents a series of lights and sounds for the player to repeat. It begins with one and every time the player successfully reproduces the sequence, it increases by one. 
If you make a mistake, you lose !
